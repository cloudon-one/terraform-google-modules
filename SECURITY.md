## Security Best Practices

### 🛡️ For Contributors

When contributing to this project:

1. **Never commit sensitive data**:

   ```bash
   # Use .gitignore patterns
   *.tfvars
   *.tfstate
   *.tfstate.backup
   .terraform/
   secrets/
   ```

2. **Use secure coding practices**:
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Validate all inputs and outputs
   - Use secure defaults
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Security review checklist**:
   - [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
   - [ ] Proper IAM roles and permissions
   - [ ] Network security controls in place
   - [ ] Encryption at rest and in transit
   - [ ] Audit logging enabled
   - [ ] Resource deletion protection

### 🏗️ For Users

When using these modules:

1. **Secrets Management**:

   ```hcl
   # ❌ Don't do this
   variable "db_password" {
     default = "hardcoded-password"
   }
   
   # ✅ Do this instead
   variable "db_password" {
     description = "Database password - should be provided via environment variable"
     type        = string
     sensitive   = true
   }
   ```

2. **Network Security**:

   ```hcl
   # Enable private clusters
   private_cluster_config {
     enable_private_nodes    = true
     enable_private_endpoint = true
   }
   
   # Restrict authorized networks
   master_authorized_networks_config {
     cidr_blocks {
       cidr_block   = "10.0.0.0/8"  # Corporate network only
       display_name = "corporate-network"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **State File Security**:

   ```hcl
   # Use remote state with encryption
   terraform {
     backend "gcs" {
       bucket  = "terraform-state-bucket"
       prefix  = "terraform/state"
       encryption_key = "your-kms-key"
     }
   }
   ```

### Version Support Policy

- **Active support**: Regular updates, bug fixes, and security patches
- **Security fixes**: Only critical security vulnerabilities

## Security Architecture

### 🏛️ Defense in Depth

Our modules implement multiple layers of security:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Internet] --> B[Cloud Armor WAF]
    B --> C[Load Balancer]
    C --> D[VPC Network]
    D --> E[Private GKE Cluster]
    D --> F[Private Cloud SQL]
    E --> G[Workload Identity]
    F --> H[Private IP Only]
    
    I[Bastion Host] --> D
